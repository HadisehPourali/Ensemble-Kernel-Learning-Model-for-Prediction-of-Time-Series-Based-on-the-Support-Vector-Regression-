Time series prediction based on support vector regression

# Background
Time series prediction is a process which predicted future system values based on information obtained from past and present data points. 
The main purpose of using different models for time series prediction is to make the forecast with the greatest accuracy

In this repository, a new model for time series prediction is presented based on support vector regression and weighted combination of different kernels and optimization 
of parameters and their weights by the optimizer. In successive iterations of the competency function, the optimizer learns the optimal values of the particle array 
and uses those values to evaluate the test data.
